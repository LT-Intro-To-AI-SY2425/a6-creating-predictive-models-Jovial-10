# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this linear regression model?

The r squared value is 0.626. This tells me that the linear regression model is somewhat accurate, but not fully accurate.

2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person who is 42 years old?

The predicted systolic blood pressure for a person who is 42 is about 136.5

3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?

I think it's accurate based on the data given to us, but in real life, there are many more factors that are required to predict a person's blood pressure besides age. I think we could improve the model by adding a larger data set that includes a more diverse range of data.
