Each group is different and has different data, so they must be classified differently.

2. What group would a customer who has a medium income and low spending habits be in?

Probably a High income - low spender because they have medium income but don't spend much.

3. Choose one cluster of interest to you. How might the marketing team approach this specific customer group?

The medium average cluster of people would represent the middle class citizens. A marketing team would likely approach this group with advertisements that are for the average person, such as a 6$ coffee from Starbucks or a house appliance from Walmart.
