# Part 3 - Multivariable Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part3.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the R Squared coefficient for your model? What does that mean about the model in relation to your data?

My highest R Squared coefficient was 0.94. This means that my model in relation to my date is extremely accurate.

2. Is your model accurate? Why or why not?

Yes, it is signifcantly more accurate than my previous models. I know this because the predicitons were more accurate than my older models. 

3. What does the model predict a 10-year-old car with 89000 miles is worth? What about a car that is 20 years old with 150000 miles?

Predicted price for 10-year-old car with 89,000 miles: $8667.19
Predicted price for 20-year-old car with 150,000 miles: $648.13

4. You may notice that some of your predicted results are negative. This is occurring when the value of age and the mileage of the car are very high. Why do you think this is happening?

There might not be enough data with higher values that the model can base predictions off of. They may stray away from the linear trend of the model.
